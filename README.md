# :orange_book: Table of contents 

This project is about learning and applying algorithms to predict / group patient based if they will have an heart-attack or not.  
We are going to implement many supervised and unsupervised algorithms and find the best.

Supervised algorithms : 
* Decision tree
* Random Forest
* Adabosst
* SVM
* KNN
* Naive Bayes

Unsupervised algorithms :
* K-Means
* Agglomerative hierarchical clustering
* DBSCAN
* HDBSCAN




# :seedling: Data source

The datasource we are using is patient having heart-attack based on somes features.
